# Carter Groff — Portfolio

Carter Groff's personal portfolio site: a single-page, dark "Parlor" themed
site (gas lamp, candlelight, botanical motifs) built with React + Babel
loaded directly from a CDN — no build step, no bundler. Content (bio, video
reel, design work, résumé, travels) is data-driven so it can be edited
without touching the page markup.

## Project structure

```
Carter Portfolio.html   The public site — loads the scripts below in order
app.jsx                  Mounts <Portfolio /> once content has loaded
themes.jsx               Design tokens (colors, type, spacing) + global CSS/animations
data.jsx                 Default content (bio, videos, designs, résumé, travels)
motifs.jsx               Reusable decorative components (gas lamp, botanicals, raven — unused)
portfolio.jsx            Page sections + composition (Hero, About, Video, Design, Résumé, Contact)
cg-store.js              Shared storage helper used by the site and the admin CMS
assets/                  Images (portrait, etc.)

Admin.html               Content editor (CMS) — not linked from the public site
admin.jsx                Admin app shell (editor + live preview split view)
admin-ui.jsx             Admin form primitives (fields, buttons, image/PDF upload)
admin-sections.jsx       Admin form sections (Identity, About, Videos, Designs, Résumé, Travels)
```

## Running locally

This is a static site — no `npm install`, no build command. Any static file
server works:

```bash
cd "Carter Groff Website code"
python3 -m http.server 8765
```

Then open `http://localhost:8765/Carter%20Portfolio.html` for the site, or
`http://localhost:8765/Admin.html` for the content editor.

## Editing content

Open `Admin.html` and edit any section (Identity, About, Video Work, Design
Work, Résumé, Travels) — changes autosave as you type, and the live preview
pane on the right updates instantly.

> **Status:** the admin currently saves to the browser's local storage
> (IndexedDB), so edits show up in that same browser only. Wiring the admin
> to a real shared database (so edits from any device show up on the live
> site) is in progress — this section will be updated once that lands.

## Deployment

Hosted on Vercel, auto-deploying from the `main` branch of this repo.
